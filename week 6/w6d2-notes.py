# - can only find ONE UNIQUE value, no duplicates
# - can only be performed on ORDERED collections
# ordering: ascending(low to high), descending(high to low)
# alphabet - ascending - aAbBcCdD... and so on
# minimum will always start at 0 in this class
# max will always be the length of the list minus 1
# ALWAYS SORT BEFORE SEARCH!!! DONT DO SEARCH FIRST
