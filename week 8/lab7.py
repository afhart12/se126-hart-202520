#Program Prompt: Access the words.csv file and store the data to a dictionary, where each word in the file is a key of the dictionary and the value stored to each key is the wordâ€™s corresponding definition. Then, create a repeatable program that allows a user to interact with the dictionary based on the following menu: 1 = show all words, 2 = search for a word, 3 = add a word, 4 = exit

# variable dictionary:
#dictionary = my created dictionary that holds all of the words from the csv file and their definitions
# menu = a value to determine if the while loop keeps running
# opt = menu option that the user selects, either 1 2 3 or 4
# found = a list to hold the values found by my sequential search loop that relate to the users search
# search = a value holding the users search entry
# newWord = a value holding the users entry for a new word
# newdef = a value holding the users entry for a new definition relating to the word they put in
# flag = a variable that changes based on if the new word is the same as a word that already exists in the dictionary
