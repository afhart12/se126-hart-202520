# ask user for row number, check for validity, ask for seat letter, check for validity, place x at that coordinate

# if seat == x, they cant sit there, else, change value to x

# if user wants to sit in row 1, 1st position, index 0, subtract 1 from user row entry
# row -1 = index
# 4 if statements, row value, seat value
# do not need index to hold rows, a list, b list, c list, d list
